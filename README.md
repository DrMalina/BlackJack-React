# BlackJack React

This is a website created as a result of final project of CL bootcamp. 

The goal was to construct a web page related to the BlackJack card game, where user is able to find 
some general information, along with rules regarding the game, but it is also possible to play a simplified
version of BlackJack in one of the tabs.

The site is built on REACT and follows RWD principals.

### Technologies used:
* ES 6
* React
* SASS
* Fetch, API (cards image): https://deckofcardsapi.com/

### Bugs/ To do list:
* Tabs such as Home, Info, Contact to switch between et cetera (not yet implemented)
* Missing card animation on second and further deals 
* Fixed score counting - 'ACE' should switch value from 11 to 1 (and other way) in some scenarios


You can preview the project here: http://bljr.surge.sh/#/
Please note however, that it is not the final version yet.

Enjoy!
